# RiverBooks
This is a demo application based on the Dometrain course, "Getting Started: Modular Monoliths in .NET" by Steve "ardalis" Smith.

## Under construction
This project is still under contruction as I'm currently taking this course.

## Deviations from the course
The major deviation is that I'm using Minimal APIs instead of the 'FastEndpoints' nuget package used by the course instructor.  I decided Minimal APIs more closely align with my goals and learning objectives, without obscuring the purpose of the subject matter, which is to learn Modular Monoliths, and not necessarily introduce _unnecessary_ nuget dependencies, which from my perspective is a mattter of style.

## Tech Stack
This project uses:
- ASP.NET Core Minimal APIs
- Entity Framework Core
- xUnit Tests
